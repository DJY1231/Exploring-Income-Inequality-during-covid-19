# Exploring_Income_Inequality_in_Canada_During_Major_Recessions

## Overview
This paper examines income inequality in Canada from 2002 to 2023 using data from the World Inequality Database (WID) and Statistics Canada. The analysis explores trends in income inequality and inflation, assessing whether these disparities have increased or decreased over time. It also compares the impacts of the Great Recession (2007–2009) and the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2023) on income disparities. Through data analysis and regression modeling, this study investigates these trends in depth. Understanding these patterns is crucial for policymakers and the government to develop effective strategies aimed at reducing inequalities within the country. This report ultimately seeks to contribute to efforts promoting social and economic equity in Canada.
