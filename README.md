# Exploring_Income_Inequality_in_Canada_During_Major_Recessions

## Overview
This paper examines income inequality in Canada from 2002 to 2023 using data from the World Inequality Database (WID) and Statistics Canada. Throughout the analysis, we explore trends in income inequality and inflation, assessing whether it has increased or decreased over time, and compare the impacts of the Great Recession (2007–2009) and the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2023) on income disparities. Data analysis and regression modeling are utilized to investigate these trends. Understanding these patterns is significant, as it could help policymakers and the government develop strategies to reduce inequalities within the country. Consequently, this report aims to support efforts to promote social and economic equity in Canada.
